Neel Thomas here; I'm a DevOps consultant. I began working as a Linux System Administrator in 2015, then in 2017 I moved over to working as DevOps.

Over the past few years, I've worked for and helped the organisations on the following list achieve hyper scaled growth.

* [Ola Cabs](https://www.olacabs.com/)

Starting from scratch I have built the entire Infrastructure and implemented DevOps/SRE practise's in below companies.

* [Zolve](https://zolve.com/) : Neo bank valued at $210 Million based out of US and India.
* [Arcab](https://arcab.ae/)  : Mobility company based in Dubai.
